# rationale
I know it seems trivial: a birthday planner.

What this is a POC. 

I asked Sequential Thinking MCP to help me work through the issues connected to throwing a party. I had set Cline to ask only one question at a time see: questions_asked_and_answered_20250508_124650.md

Then after all of the questions were answered, Sequential Thinking MCP created a worksheet. 

I told Cline to use the worksheet to create a JSON based file system that connected to Streamlit.

This POC took less than 20 minutes to get working. 

It points to a process whereby users can leverage the 'outside of the box' thinking to plan and anticipate unexpected circumstances. 

The output might seem trivial but there are a number of use cases:
- Strategic Planning – Defining long-term business goals, market positioning, and competitive strategy.
- Financial Forecasting – Creating detailed budgets, investment plans, and revenue projections.
- Product Development – Planning a new product or service, from concept to launch.
- Marketing Campaigns – Crafting multi-channel strategies, branding, and customer engagement initiatives.
- Supply Chain Management – Coordinating logistics, sourcing materials, and ensuring efficiency in production.
- Business Expansion – Planning for mergers, acquisitions, or entering new markets.
- Risk Management – Identifying potential risks and creating mitigation strategies.
- Hiring & Talent Development – Recruiting, training, and retaining top talent.
- Customer Relationship Management – Building loyalty and long-term engagement with clients.
- Legal & Compliance Preparation – Ensuring adherence to regulations, contracts, and industry standards.
